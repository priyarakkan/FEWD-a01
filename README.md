## About myself
Hi I am *Priyadharsini Rakkan*! I am from **Tamilnadu southern part of India**. In my family, myself, dad, mom and one big sister. I am engineering graduate. After marriage i moved here, **San Diego USA**. Last 6 years i am in this beautiful city. 

This place is connected to my heart because my daughter was born here. Now she is doing her grade 1. When she came into my life everything changed. I am thinking only about her future. I can easily separate my life before her and after her. First i thought mother's love is very pure than anything, When she enter into my life i daily melt of her love. My only wise is make all her wise possible.

My hobbies are:
* Reading books
* designing dresses and sew *only for ladies*
* painting, but not very good
